# Happy Diwali - HTML & CSS Project

This repository contains a simple, festive "Happy Diwali" webpage designed using only HTML and CSS. The page is a visual greeting to celebrate the festival of lights, Diwali. The design includes vibrant colors, text animations, and a decorative background that captures the spirit of the festival.

## Features

- **Pure HTML & CSS:** The webpage is built entirely with HTML and CSS without any JavaScript or external libraries.
- **Festive Design:** Includes Diwali-themed colors, shapes (like diyas), and animations to create a festive greeting page.
- **Responsive Layout:** The page is designed to look good on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **CSS Animations:** Subtle animations such as glowing diyas (lamps) or flickering lights to enhance the Diwali vibe.

- `DIWALI.css`: Contains the CSS rules that define the festive look, including colors, fonts, background decorations, and animations.

## How it Works

- **Background Decorations**: The page uses CSS for creating Diwali-themed shapes like diyas, fireworks, or candles using CSS properties such as `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, and gradients.
- **Text Animations**: The "Happy Diwali" message is animated using CSS keyframes for effects like glowing, fading, or sliding.
- **Color Scheme**: The page uses vibrant and traditional Diwali colors like yellow, orange, gold, and dark blue to give a warm, festive feel.

## How to Customize

1. **Change the Greeting Message**:
   Modify the text in the `DIWALI.html` file to customize the greeting message.

2. **Experiment with CSS Animations**:
